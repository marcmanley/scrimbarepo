        <h2>Who Is Alex Jones?</h2>
        <p>Jones suggested “fake” celebrities like pop star <strong>Justin Bieber</strong> are part of an effort to turn children into <em>“mindless vassals,”</em> instead of looking up to individualist heroes like <strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong>, inventor <strong>Nicola Tesla</strong>, and <strong>Ferdinand Magellan</strong>.</p>
        <p><em>“I mean, kids, Magellan is a lot cooler than Justin Bieber!”</em> Jones screamed, going on to describe Magellan’s hair-raising circumnavigation of the globe and death at the hands of <em>“wild natives.”</em></p>
        <blockquote>“Going into space! Mathematics! Quantum mechanics! It’s all there! The secrets of the universe! Life is fiery with its beauty, its incredible detail, tuning into it!” Jones continued, expanding on other things he thinks are cooler than celebrities. “And they want to shatter your mind talking about Justin Bieber!”</blockquote>

          <h2>YouTube Controvery</h2>
          <p>Alex Jones, the founder, owner and star of Infowars, has been kicked off YouTube. The Alex Jones Channel, Infowars' biggest YouTube account with 2.4 million subscribers, now simply bears the message "this account has been terminated for violating YouTube's Community Guidelines." YouTube has a "three strikes" policy that terminates accounts after three violations of its community guidelines within three months. Its removal of Alex Jones' channel follows Apple, Spotify and Facebook all removing Infowars content from their platforms.</p>
          <p>Earlier this year, the channel had racked up "strikes" after posting multiple clips about the February 14th shooting massacre at a Florida high school that falsely alleged the survivors were "crisis actors." YouTube has a policy forbidding malicious harassment and bullying.</p>
