      <p>Jones has promoted conspiracy theories alleging that the United States government either concealed information about or outright falsified the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the September 11 attacks, and the 1969 Moon landing.</p>
      <p>He has claimed that several governments and big businesses have colluded to create a <a href="#">"New World Order"</a> through <em>"manufactured economic crises, sophisticated surveillance tech and—above all—inside-job terror attacks that fuel exploitable hysteria"</em>.</p>
